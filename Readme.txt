____________________________

design a database that will collect users data when they want to contact us
the database has to include
1. name of user
2. address 3. email 4. call time and date  5. problem to be solved  6. expected date for delivery to be performed
7. amount to be paid in naira  8. amount he or she has already paid

as for the blog, it should show the comment of the readers and post their comments

your suggestions
should i include pricing so that they can make purchases? something like advertise our product and provide a button 
for Buy Now listing all prices?

thanks bro
